# python-keras
AUR package for Keras that actually matches with the Tensorflow package version

# Version mismatch
The Arch repositories have mismatching Tensorflow and Keras package versions, so some stuff in Tensorflow doesn't work properly

# How to install
```sh
git clone https://github.com/amogustroll69/python-keras.git
cd python-keras
makepkg -si
```
